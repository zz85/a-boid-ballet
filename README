A tiny journal about this journey

this is a project i am working on
 a little work to assemble my experimentations
 a little showcase for three.js and shader authors
 a little attempt to push myself
  to write some code
  to utter some expressions
  to produce a personal work
 it may be difficult
 it may be painful
 it may not turn out the way i envision
 but i should try
 and should i fail
 i should learn
 and work on to be something better
it has to start
the ideas should crystalize
the foundation should lay
the tools must utilize
it begins with this commit
